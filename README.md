Detect unknown words in web pages and display their dictionary definitions to help English learners read English web pages smoothly.

### Long Description

很多英文学习者学习了大半辈子英语，却从未真正阅读过几本原版世界名著，也没有阅读过多少英文的新闻报纸。如果我们能在日常生活中把英语用起来，就不会陷于一直学但是一只学不好的尴尬境地。

有时候我们想阅读英文书籍或网页，但是词汇量不够。手工为每一个生词查字典又非常麻烦，往往让人无法坚持下去。这个软件就是为解决上述烦恼而生。

该软件围绕个人词汇表这个核心概念，在英文网页上自动为用户展示陌生单词的词典释义。帮助英文水平不高的人顺利阅读英文书籍。在阅读过程中，该软件会显示当前页面的所有生词。用户可以随时标记单词为“认识”或者“不认识”。凡是标记为“认识”的单词，将来就不会在文章里显示词典释义。随着不断的阅读和标记，我们的词汇表越来越精准。而且，在阅读过程中，无意识的记住了更多的单词。这些单词与小说情节相关联，更不容易忘记。


Many English learners have studied English for most of their lives, but have never actually read a few original world famous books, nor have they read many English newspapers. If we can use English in our daily lives, we won't be in the embarrassing situation of always learning but failing to learn one language well.

Sometimes we want to read English books or web pages, but our vocabulary is not enough. Manually searching the dictionary for each new word is very cumbersome and often makes it impossible to persist. This software is designed to solve the above problems.

The software revolves around the core concept of personal vocabulary and automatically displays dictionary definitions of unfamiliar words for users on English web pages. Help people with low English proficiency to read English books smoothly. During the reading process, the software will display all new words on the current page. Users can mark words as "known" or "unknown" at any time. Any words marked as "knowledge" will not have dictionary definitions displayed in articles in the future. As we continue to read and mark, our vocabulary becomes more and more precise. Moreover, during the reading process, more words are remembered unconsciously. These words are associated with the plot of the novel and are harder to forget.

## Why I made it?
作为一个英语爱好者，我一直希望自己能有阅读英文书籍的能力。但是我的英语词汇量有限，看一页内容，我都会遇到很多的生词，查字典非常低效。我看到有一些书籍是有双语版本的，电脑上也有全文翻译的软件。但是看全文翻译过的内容跟看中文版有什么区别？我希望的是在看英文书的同时，提高我的词汇量。也就是说，我希望大部分内容还是我自己来理解，少部分不认识的单词能够在旁边显示中文释义。多年来我一直没找到满足我需求的阅读软件。

2024年的某一天，我决定自己动手做一个这样的软件，首先满足我自己的需求。然后分享给有相同需求的同好们。

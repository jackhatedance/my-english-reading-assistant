### Long Description

很多人在学校学习了多年英语，并且通过了英语等级考试，但是没看过几本英文书。毕业以后渐渐地就把英语忘光了。如果我们能在日常生活中把英语用起来，就不会陷于一直学一直忘尴尬境地。

我们想阅读英文原著，但是词汇量不够，几乎每一页里都包含很多生词。手工为每一个生词查字典又非常麻烦，往往让人无法坚持阅读。这个软件就是为这个解决问题而生。

该软件围绕个人词汇表这个核心概念，在英文网页上自动为用户展示陌生单词的词典释义。帮助英文水平不高的人顺利阅读英文书籍。在阅读过程中，该软件会显示当前页面的所有生词。用户可以随时标记单词为“认识”或者“不认识”。凡是标记为“认识”的单词，将来就不会在文章里显示词义。随着不断的阅读和标记，我们的个人词汇表越来越精准。而且，在阅读过程中，无意识的记住了更多的单词。这些单词与小说情节相关联，更不容易忘记。


Many people have studied English for many years in school and passed the English proficiency test, but have not read many English books. After graduation, they gradually forget all their English. If we can use English in our daily lives, we will not be trapped in the embarrassing situation of learning and forgetting all the time.

We want to read English originals, but our vocabulary is not enough, and almost every page contains many new words. It is very troublesome to manually look up the dictionary for each new word, which often makes people unable to persist in reading. This software is born to solve this problem.

The software revolves around the core concept of personal vocabulary, and automatically displays the dictionary definitions of unfamiliar words for users on English web pages. Helps people with low English proficiency to read English books smoothly. During the reading process, the software will display all the new words on the current page. Users can mark words as "recognized" or "unrecognized" at any time. Any word marked as "recognized" will not show the meaning in the article in the future. With continuous reading and marking, our personal vocabulary becomes more and more accurate. Moreover, during the reading process, more words are unconsciously remembered. These words are related to the plot of the novel and are less likely to be forgotten.

## Why I made it?
作为一个英语爱好者，我一直希望自己能有阅读英文小说的能力。但是我的英语词汇量有限，看一页内容，我都会遇到很多的生词，查字典非常低效。我看到有一些书籍是有双语版本的，电脑上也有全文翻译的软件。但是看全文翻译过的内容跟看中文版有什么区别？我希望的是在看英文书的同时，也能提高我的词汇量。也就是说，我希望大部分内容还是我自己来理解，少部分不认识的单词能够在旁边显示中文释义。多年来我一直没找到满足我需求的阅读软件。

2024年的某一天，我决定自己动手做一个这样的软件，首先满足我自己的需求。然后分享给有相同需求的同好们。
